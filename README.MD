# Disclaimer

This is the clean architecture approach used by the Fullcycle college, but I don't really feel like it is "clean", 
at the start of the project, there's so much code involved just for a single use case (adding order), things could be simpler.
This might feel like a maze for people who are just starting, so from my perspective, this goes against what the book
clean architecture preaches.

# Challenge

We get a new order and we have to calculate the price and the interest
